🧑‍💻 A. Customer Journey (Sample Customers)

Customer 1
    Started with a 7-day free trial
    After the trial, downgraded to the Basic monthly plan
    Continues as a paying Basic customer

Customer 2
    Began with the free trial
    After trial completion, upgraded directly to the Pro annual plan
    Became a long-term high-value customer

Customer 3
    Signed up for the free trial
    Converted to the Basic monthly plan
    Remained on the Basic plan afterward

Customer 4
    Started on the free trial
    Moved to the Basic monthly plan
    Did not upgrade further within the sample period

Customer 5
    Joined via the free trial
    Converted to the Pro monthly plan
    Later churned, indicating cancellation after being a paid Pro customer

Customer 6
    Started with the trial plan
    Upgraded to Pro monthly
    Continued as an active Pro customer

Customer 7
    Entered through the free trial
    Upgraded to Pro monthly
    Later upgraded again to Pro annual, showing strong engagement

Customer 8
    Signed up for the free trial
    Cancelled during or immediately after the trial
    Resulted in churn without becoming a paid customer

✅ Key Takeaway
    Every customer starts with a trial
    Customers either:
    Convert to Basic
    Convert to Pro (monthly or annual)
    Or churn
    Upgrades to higher plans happen immediately
    Churn reflects intent to cancel, not instant loss of access
